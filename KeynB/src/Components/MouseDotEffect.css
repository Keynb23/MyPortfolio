       the container will naturally expand. If not, set a suitable min-height here. */

   is visible and layered above the canvas. */

/* Example for the main content wrapped by MouseDotEffect */
/* This assumes your <main> tag inside MouseDotEffect has the class "main-content" */
.main-content {
    position: relative; /* Essential to allow z-index to work */
    z-index: 1; /* Place the main content above the canvas (which is z-index: 0) */

       if you want to see the dots through it. */
    /*
    background-color: rgba(var(--your-theme-color), 0.8); // Example: slightly transparent background
    */
    /* If your surveyData.backgroundTheme sets a solid color, the dots will be hidden by it.
       Consider using rgba colors for main-content or ensuring your sections have transparent backgrounds. */
}

/* If individual sections (Hero, XpCards, etc.) have their own backgrounds,
   you might need to adjust their backgrounds to be semi-transparent or remove them if possible,
   so the canvas dots can be seen through. */

/* Also check individual components: */
/* For instance, if Hero has a solid background: */
/*
.hero-section {
    background-color: transparent !important; // Or rgba for transparency
}
*/
/* The same for XpCards, Projects, Edu, etc. */
